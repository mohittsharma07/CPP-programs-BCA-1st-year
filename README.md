# C++ Programs – BCA 1st Year

This repository contains a collection of *C++ programs* that I learned during my *BCA 1st Year at CSJMU, Kanpur*.  
It covers Object-Oriented Programming concepts, basic to intermediate logic building, and problem-solving.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors (Default, Parameterized, Copy)  
- Constructor Overloading  
- Destructor  
- Function Overloading  
- Friend Function  
- File Handling (File I/O)  
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Multiple)  
- Polymorphism (Runtime using Virtual Functions)  
- Passing Objects to Functions  
- User-defined Data Types  
- Exception Handling  
- Templates  
- Dynamic Classes (Pass-by-value)

## 🛠 How to Compile & Run

Using *G++ Compiler*:

g++ filename.cpp -o output ./output

*Example:*

g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello ./hello

## 📄 File Naming Convention

Each file is named according to the concept demonstrated. For example:

- constructor_overloading.cpp → Demonstrates constructor overloading  
- friend_function.cpp → Demonstrates use of friend function  
- file_io_example.cpp → Shows file input/output in C++  
- user_define_datatype.cpp → Demonstrates user-defined data types
